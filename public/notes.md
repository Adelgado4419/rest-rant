## information
In order to have local front-end files, we have to host them in a static folder. Typically we do this in a folder called 'public' or 'static'.

Static files are files that don't dynamically change - i.e., they aren't generated by code. It includes front-end code such as HTML, CSS, front-end JavaScript, and image assets.
